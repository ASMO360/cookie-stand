      <p>On a grey Seattle day our founder Pat had developed a recipe for a coffee-time confection of two signature Seattle icons and created the world famous Salmon Cookies.</p>

      <p>They're cookies made into the shape of a salmon with the finest ingredients that our famous local Salmon.  Salmon cookies are an a suprisingly tasty treat and an ideal match for a steaming cup of coffee. Tourists and locals have fallen in love with these world famous salmon cookies.
